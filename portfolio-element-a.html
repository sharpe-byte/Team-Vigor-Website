				Since our devices where use on a daily basics are such susceptible to damage, we will find a way to inherently improve the durability and life span of these overused devices.

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> The article begins with saying that the best smartphones currently in the market offer “extreme durability”, massive batteries and specific features to outdoor cases. Normally these smartphones are dust and water resistant, or sometimes totally water resistant. The articles still continues to state some features these “rugged” smartphones has. The article then ends with their recommendations for phones.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> The article comes off as to say that phones are already durable and need little to no room for improvement. Even in the need of the user not liking the durability of the phones, they have option to special case specific features. The articles refers to phone durability as if they're already too durable in higher end models and the problem is slowly fading.

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> The document starts off by saying that many unique smartphones are available on the market, but recent trends show that the replacement cycle have become less than 2 years and the environmental impacts these phones have is unmatched. They continue to state reasons that they phones are being dumped, display, back cover, and software to a few of many continuous factors.  They state that the problem can be easily be fixed by making more durable phones, the article continues giving data to manufactures that might consider making more durable phones.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> This article clearly states the phones are not durable enough, it even reaches to say that that the software used in these smartphones is not enough with the average life expectancy of a phone to be about two years. They support our claim that phone need to become more durable, because in the case of simply making more durable phone can lead from the environmental issues of these deteriorating phones.

					<div class="article-content">
						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Source (APA format):</span> Chokkattu, J. (2021, January 13). The Future of Phone Design: Flexible Screens That Roll Up. Retrieved from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-phone-design-ces-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-phone-design-ces-2021/</a>
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> Wired starts off the article by giving the different designs of the infamous foldable “smartphones” and the way manufacturers are increasing the production of them. They continue with some features and cost expenses of these foldable phones, until the come upon the the problem or as they call it a “barrier”. They say that most high end phones have durable glass, but as one of the earlier models of the 2019 Galaxy fold crippled due to dust entry into the screen, forcing Samsung of a long progress to adjust the hinges. They continue to say that the hinges fixed most of the issues abiding from the screen and that with the expectation of a wave of foldable phones releasing in 2021 that many more issue will occur. “Once you get to the slab of glass, there’s not a whole lot more you can do.”
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> This article says that with newer ideas of the traditional slab of the modern smartphone, the foldable phones require more diverse features, and to develop such an art piece and new glass is absolute necessary in the progression of a more futuristic smartphone. Even though this article question the durably and design of modern smartphones, it tend to go off topic about to just focus of the problem of foldable smartphones, and not modern smartphones as a whole.

						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> This article shows that a group in the South Korean institute of science and technology developed a “self-healing electronic material” that repairs itself over time  including scratches, cracks, and other damage that can be caused to the phone from drops. The material is based on linseed oil, a oil made from flax plant seeds, the material is still too new to begin being used in phones as of now but this shows that there are still advancements that can be made in phone durability.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> As seen in the article, future phones could include self-healing screens and material that could make things like cases and screen protectors absolute. Because of the simple ingredient of Flax plant seed oil this technology can be easily adapted to work with newer displays being made like flexible and folding displays that are being made by Samsung and Motorola.

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> In this article Neal Dexter a man who owns and operates a phone repair shop in Chicago asks why so many people are breaking their phones? The answer to that question is the design of new smart phones which prioritize larger screens and thinner chassis, a combination of these two is causing phones to be much more fragile. The most ironic part about this is that these new phones that are more fragile tend to cost more, a new top of the line phone can end up costing you somewhere from $800-$1500 depending on the company you buy from.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> The article shows that smartphones breaking or being damaged  is still a problem that most people have to face in their lives and because of the large amount of money that it would cost to repair or replace the phones most people just decide to live with their screens or back sides of their phones broken. This conundrum of either spending.

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Summary:</span> The Article talks about how it is important to have people to have support from friends and family because it helps with happiness and health, and makes it easier for the individual to share information, grab economic opportunities, and learn from other people. People use social media to communicate and socialize with other people. The data supports the claim that phone durability is indeed a problem worldwide because Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms that people use today, and there are over 2.3 billion users that use Facebook. If people using Facebook have to deal with their phones being damaged or broken easily then that’s a problem because to repair or to buy phones are expensive. This is a huge inconvenience because with broken or damaged phones, users won’t be able to connect to people, talk to people, and do other things on social media, especially for people who have only a phone to connect to the internet. The data doesn’t challenge the claim of phone durability because it doesn’t talk about phone durability, the article talks about social well-being and loneliness, and how that is influenced by friends and family, the internet, social media apps, and so on.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Artifact Critique:</span> This chart shows the number of people using social media platforms from 2004-2009. Facebook is the most popular social media app with over 2 billion users. Phones break and get easily damaged but if there are more than 2 billion people using facebook on their phones, people with the broken phones will have to pay a hefty price to get their phone working or buy a new phone.
