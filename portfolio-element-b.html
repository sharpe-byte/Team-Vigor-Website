                <span class="paragraph-heading">Summary:</span> In this project
                they were able to model a phone protective case that protects
                the front and the back of the mobile phone while having a camera
                built in on it to help. The case is well layered and made of 3
                parts and is able to close and cover over the front of the phone
                for protection when not being used. The case allows the phone to
                be safe when it is not being used and it is able to be removed
                and is never permanently attached to the case.

                entering the mobile phone completely while allowing the phone to
                still operate. The model is able to open and close around the
                phone to allow usage without the adhesive body getting in the
                way of the user.

                used in phone cases, it protects the components on electronic
                devices such as buttons and controls from being damaged by
                falls, impacts, or blows. It’s called the Electronic device
                shock absorber where it absorbs the shock in the place of the
                phone when in an unfortunate case, the phone might suffer damage
                due to a fall or if it comes in contact with something.

                patent attempts to solve the problem by protecting the
                electronic components of phones such as buttons and controls
                which is a good attribute. But a bad attribute is that this is a
                housing that is used in phone cases. While it may protect the
                back and the sides of the phone, it fails to protect the front
                side or screen of the phone. The website mostly talks about the
                materials used in making the patent, and the reason this patent
                was created was to protect the phone and reduce the chances the
                user has to go to buy a phone/replacement.

                <span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Summary:</span> The
                patent is called Screen Protector, which is a frameless and
                transparent protector screen that is arranged and fixed onto the
                screen of an electronic device. This patent is made to protect
                the screen of an electronic device from being fractured due to
                damage from impact. It fixes the screen of a device through the
                use of an adhesive. It is used in the patent US9063699B1 (Glass
                touch screen protector).

                an electronic device from being fractured which is a good
                attribute. But a bad attribute is that the patent doesn’t say
                anything about dust or air bubbles getting stuck in the screen
                protector, and the patent also doesn’t mention anything about
                how strong the screen protector is (like how well can it protect
                the device from scratches and at what distance of fall will it
                keep the screen of device from being fractured). The website
                mostly talks about how it was designed and the materials used.
