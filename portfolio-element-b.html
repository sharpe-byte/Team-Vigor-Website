							Jochen Flohrschütz - Google Patent - Worldwide applications (June 10, 2013) Protective cover for mobile phones with built-in camera<br />
							<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/DE202012007163U1/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://patents.google.com/patent/DE202012007163U1/en</a><br />
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Number:</span> DE202012007163U1
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Summary:</span> In this project they were able to model a phone protective case that protects the front and the back of the mobile phone while having a camera built in on it to help. The case is well layered and made of 3 parts and is able to close and cover over the front of the phone for protection when not being used. The case allows the phone to be safe when it is not being used and it is able to be removed and is never permanently attached to the case.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Critique:</span> This project can be quite helpful as it keeps your phone safe while being used and when it is not.

						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Summary:</span> Phones being waterproof have been at minds for a long time and it is getting closer to being solved. With this model it relates to a waterproof cover for a mobile phone that prevents water from entering the mobile phone completely while allowing the phone to still operate. The model is able to open and close around the phone to allow usage without the adhesive body getting in the way of the user.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Critique:</span> This project has been put together well to allow a phone to operate without having it be in risk of water damages.

							<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5360108A/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://patents.google.com/patent/US5360108A/en</a><br />
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Number:</span> US5360108A
						</p>

						<p>
							Patent Summary:</span> A housing used in phone cases, it protects the components on electronic devices such as buttons and controls from being damaged by falls, impacts, or blows. It’s called the Electronic device shock absorber where it absorbs the shock in the place of the phone when in an unfortunate case, the phone might suffer damage due to a fall or if it comes in contact with something.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Critique:</span> The patent attempts to solve the problem by protecting the electronic components of phones such as buttons and controls which is a good attribute. But a bad attribute is that this is a housing that is used in phone cases. While it may protect the back and the sides of the phone, it fails to protect the front side or screen of the phone. The website mostly talks about the materials used in making the patent, and the reason this patent was created was to protect the phone and reduce the chances the user has to go to buy a phone/replacement.

							Benning, J. M. (2000, September 20). Screen protector. Google Patents.<br />
							<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6750922B1/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://patents.google.com/patent/US6750922B1/en</a><br />
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Number:</span> US6750922B1
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Summary:</span> The patent is called Screen Protector, which is a frameless and transparent protector screen that is arranged and fixed onto the screen of an electronic device. This patent is made to protect the screen of an electronic device from being fractured due to damage from impact. It fixes the screen of a device through the use of an adhesive. It is used in the patent US9063699B1 (Glass touch screen protector).
						</p>

						<p>
							<span class="paragraph-heading">Patent Critique:</span> The patent attempts to solve the problem by protecting the screen of an electronic device from being fractured which is a good attribute. But a bad attribute is that the patent doesn’t say anything about dust or air bubbles getting stuck in the screen protector, and the patent also doesn’t mention anything about how strong the screen protector is (like how well can it protect the device from scratches and at what distance of fall will it keep the screen of device from being fractured). The website mostly talks about how it was designed and the materials used.
